How to share one single internet connection provided by multiple limited data wireless internet connection on both lan and wireless

I have no ADSL at home. To connect to the internet I use a 4G modem. 
Wortthly, the amount of usable data is limited and not enough to cover my needs.

I also have two 4G mobiles with sharing connection available.

I want a centralized device able to share each of (4G modem, 4 mobile 1 an 4G mobile 2) internet connections "multiplexed" into one single internet access shared through ethernet and wireless.

The fabulous device switch between each available connections according to :

- the connections are reachables (a mobile can be out of home, thus unreachable) ;
- The connection is an authorized one (if I am near a complete consumption of data on my mobile I don't want to share my connection anymore to be able to use my phone normally when I'm outside home) ;
- select 4G modem last (use it only when no other solution is possible to ensure minimization of data consumption, thus home is always connected).
